## *Summary* 
Every day, many people struggle with choosing a recipe to cook their meals. We have developed a robust interface that helps users quickly view meals that utilize several ingredients within their pantries. When you select the ingredients you already have in your pantry, our program will suggest recipes that contain them, helping immensely in the cooking process.

## *User Story:*
- **As a User** I would like to obtain a selection of recipes to make a meal from. I would like the option to select common ingredients I have in my pantry or fridge, and get recipe suggestions based on those ingredients. I also want the option to retrieve a random recipe.
- **I want** to have multiple suggestions for a meal based on a few ingredient inputs or none at all.
- **So that** I can make and eat a delicious meal. 

## *Acceptance Criteria:*
- **Given** I am hungry, and need a recipe suggestion  
- **When** I enter ingredients I have in my pantry
- **Then** I am given several recipe suggestions that contain ingredients I enter
